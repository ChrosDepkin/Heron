-Need to use the screen to change CC values. Either have the value pop up as you're turning the encoder to change it,
 or have a menu on the screen like the calender menu in the demo maybe, to select a CC (fixed range of possible values
 so a selection box may work, but maybe too many).
-Current bank, sequencer track, BPM, mode.
-MIDI note for current track.
    -Maybe just have a separate tab for sequencer stuff? Current track, note, what else?
-Current octave for keyboard
