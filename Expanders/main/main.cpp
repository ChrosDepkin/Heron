/*
This file uses the expanders.h/.cpp code to test the IO expanders.
A config function for I2C is called first to set everything up, then
IO expander objects are created, and their setup functions setup the
actual IO expanders. A while loop continually checks a couple of buttons
for testing.
Button matrix is working, need to work on the encoders.
